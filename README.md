# ConsensusAlgorithm

A Simplified Top 75 Consensus Algorithm Summary.

1. Proof of Work (PoW) - Nodes compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate blocks and earn rewards (e.g., Bitcoin).

2. Proof of Stake (PoS) - Validators are selected based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold, and they can validate transactions and earn rewards (e.g., Ethereum).

3. Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) - Validators are elected by token holders and can vote on blocks, and they can be replaced if they perform poorly (e.g., EOS).

4. Proof of Authority (PoA) - Validators are authorized by a central authority and are responsible for validating transactions (e.g., POA Network).

5. Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) - Nodes communicate and agree on a specific transaction or block, and if a faulty node is identified, it can be removed (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric).
